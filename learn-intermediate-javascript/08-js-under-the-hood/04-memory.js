// When you execute a program, 
// variables and all of your objects need to be stored and accessed in memory. 

// JavaScript has two data structures for memory:

// The heap (provides dynamic memory allocation at runtime for data types that donâ€™t have a fixed size)
// The stack (used for static storage)
// When you assign values to variables, 
// the JavaScript engine is tasked with figuring out if the value is a primitive or a reference value. 
// The outcome determines if the value is stored in the heap or the stack.
