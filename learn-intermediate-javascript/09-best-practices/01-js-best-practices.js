// Overall, solutions that implement design patterns tend to be:

// DRY (Don’t repeat yourself)
// Modular
// Reusable
// Easier to maintain
// Easier to discuss with peers at a high level (vs diving into implementation details)




// In contrast to design patterns being best practices, anti-patterns describe ineffective solutions to problems that result in bad things happening, such as:

// Namespace pollution — unexpected behavior from interactions from different clients
// Increased code complexity
// Code being difficult to understand and update
// Difficulty with testing and debugging code
